h1. typrtail

Tail or cat a file: make it look like someone is typing them.  

For some processes I was monitoring, this was far more entertaining than just watching a @tail -f@.  

<pre>
user@host ~$ tail -f /var/log/messages | typrtail
</pre>

h1. FAQ

h2. What good is this?

Come on, it's just for fun.

h2. Why'd you do this?

I was overworked and needed an escape.

h2. Doesn't this already exist?

Yeah, I'm sure it does, they're probably better too, I needed a break.

h2. It's too slow, can you make it faster?

Yes, you can.  It's a plain Ruby program, open it up and take a look at the top, there are a lot of constants (yes, globals - *gasp* globals!  I know, how awful!) that control things like the typing speed.  Have at 'em!
